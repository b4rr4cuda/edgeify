# edgeify
Changes black-on-white PDFs into white-on-grey PDFs for ease of readibility and for consistent dark mode.

I don't provide the exe, just the script. The functional part are basically functions PdfToImages and SaveImages, the rest is GUI. The GUI is kind of ugly but it gets the job done. Could use a little more user-friendliness, but otherwise it's great. Bonus: if you use Goodnotes, the color matches the default gray of the dark mode templates.
